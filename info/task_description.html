<p style="text-align: justify;">
    A new pandemic is always possible (and feared), but recent experience has shown that science is currently capable of developing effective vaccines in a very short time. Another consequence of the recent pandemic is that much has been studied about epidemics in general, and several mathematical models have been developed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    In this problem we will use a simple epidemic model:
    <ul>
        <li>When a person is infected, they infect other <code>R</code> people, but only the day after their infection (<code>R</code> is called the reproductive factor of infection).</li>
        <li>No one is infected more than once.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    For example, if on day 0 of the epidemic 3 people are infected and the reproductive factor R is equal to 2, then on day 1 another 6 people are infected (3 + 6 = 9 people in total), on day 2 another 12 people are infected (3 + 6 + 12 = 21 people in total), on day 3 another 24 people infected (3 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 45 people in total), and so on.
</p>

    <img  title="example" src="{{MEDIA}}epid_days.svg" alt="example" style="max-height: 200px"/>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Given the initial number of people infected on day 0 <code>N</code> and the reproductive factor  of the epidemic <code>R</code>, write a program to determine the number of days it takes for the epidemic to infect <code>T</code> or more people in total.
